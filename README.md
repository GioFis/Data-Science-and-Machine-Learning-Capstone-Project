# Introduction

In this chapter, we will forecast if the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other companies charge up to 165 million dollars apiece; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if we can predict whether the first stage will land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This data can be utilized if another firm wishes to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This capstone project course will offer you a taste of what data scientists face when working with actual datasets in the real world. You will play the role of a Data Scientist for a startup that wants to compete with SpaceX, and you will follow the Data Science methodology, which includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders. You must guess if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land.


# Business Problem

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other companies charge up to 165 million dollars apiece; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if you can precisely anticipate the chance of the first stage rocket safely landing, you can calculate the cost of a launch. The rival startup that hired you may make better informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch using your Data Science results and models.


# Objective

To use a data science toolbox and machine learning to precisely forecast the chance of a successful first stage rocket landing and so determine the cost of a launch.
Investigate the data to have a better understanding of it.


# Business metric

Classification accuracy - number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction defined as:
